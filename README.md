# NBA Roster Builder

**Version 1.0.0**

### Description
This is a CLI application that allows a user to create an NBA roster using every player's real 2020 salary cap information. Easy Mode allows unlimited spending, Hard Mode will stop you from adding new players once you've gone too far past the hard cap. 
Finally, the user will get a cap statement that shows how far over the soft and hard cap the team is as well as their luxury tax owed.

### Motivation
I wanted to build this to get more comfortable with file I/O, PostgreSQL, and DAOs. 

### Next Steps & Contributing
I'd like to add a feature that compares your cap situation to the rest of the league. Any feedback or contributions are welcome!
